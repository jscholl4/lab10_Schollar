# EN.525.742.SP25 Lab 10

This contains everything needed to create the .bit.bin file and run on an FPGA. As noted in the lab, the test_radio.c
file can be found in the src/linux_software/ directory. All changes to the full_radio peripheral IP are found in the 
ip_repo/full_radio/ directory, while the hdl files for the IP are found in the src/ directory.

The total size of the unzipped ip_repo/full_radio/ directory is 404.5 kB.

Note that I changed "doug.bif" to "lab10_Schollar.bif". I also made the necessary changes in make_project.sh/bat and
make_bitbin.sh/bat.
